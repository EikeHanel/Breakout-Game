<h1>Breakout Game</h1>

<p>This is a simple Breakout game built using Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle</a> graphics library. The game features a paddle, a ball, and blocks. The goal is to break all the blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Control the paddle with the left and right arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Break blocks by hitting them with the ball.</li>
    <li>Speed up the ball gradually after each collision with a block.</li>
    <li>Track lives and display "You Win!" or "You Lose!" based on game status.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>No installation is required. Ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and run the main script.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breakout-game.git
cd breakout-game
python main.py
</code></pre>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.</li>
    <li>The objective is to break all the blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.</li>
    <li>If the ball falls below the paddle, you lose a life.</li>
    <li>The game ends when you lose all lives or break all the blocks.</li>
</ul>
